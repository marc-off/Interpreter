# INTERPRETER - TESTED ON MAC
Project from the Programming Languages 2 I've taken at my university (in O-Caml language).
Works like the definition of most interpreters : takes tokens as input, returns valued expressions.
A very theorical approach to the philosophy of interpreters.
Feel free to ask any doubt.
